              Career alignment refers to young people having educational plans
              that are aligned with their occupational ambitions, while career
              misalignment refers to teenagers whose educational plans are not
              aligned with their occupational ambitions. Misalignment can be
              conceived as confusion about the labour market and specifically
              the levels of education and qualifications that are typically
              required to access desired employment.
