              Economic crises are commonly characterized by sharply rising youth
              unemployment. Even under normal economic circumstances, young
              people face difficulties in their transitions into the world of
              work, often struggling to compete for available employment.
              However, it is possible for schools to help young people become
              better prepared for the difficult labor markets that they will
              face. Through career education and guidance, young people are
              helped to explore and confirm their career ambitions, to develop
              the skills required to begin managing their career journeys and to
              gain first-hand experience of the world of work. 
              Career certainty is the ability to name a job expected at age 30,
              Career certainty refers to articulation, as a teenager, of an
              occupational ambition or career expectation for adult life. It
              does not require occupational expectations to be fixed, but for a
              student to have a view on the type of job they envision in
              adulthood.  
              Teenage career certainty is significantly associated with higher
              earnings than those who were uncertain as teenagers.
